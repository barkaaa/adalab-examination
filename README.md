## Selection of Team Projects for Admission to Adalab 

For the selection of students for the next session of the coding school, students will log in using their GitHub accounts and participate in the challenges inside to assess their qualifications. The system will automatically read and test the code in the repositories set up by the students. The backend allows editing the challenges and viewing students' information.
